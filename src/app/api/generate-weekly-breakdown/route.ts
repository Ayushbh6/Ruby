   <weekly_plan>, <week_X>, <main_goal>, <concepts>, <deliverables>, <sessions>, <key_milestones>

2. WEEKLY STRUCTURE: Generate weeks that match the project duration exactly:
   - 1 week project = 1 week breakdown
   - 2 week project = 2 weeks breakdown  
   - 3 week project = 3 weeks breakdown

   - Week 2: Core functionality (JavaScript interactions)
   - Week 3: Advanced features (complex logic/integrations)
   - Week 4: Polish and finalization (optimization/showcase)

4. CONCEPTS PER WEEK: List 2-5 concepts per week:
   - Must match difficulty level (beginner = simpler, advanced = complex)
   - Must be skills actually used that week
   - Use child-friendly terms ("making buttons clickable" not "event handlers")

5. DELIVERABLES PER WEEK: List 1-4 concrete deliverables:
   - Must be DEMONSTRABLE (something they can see/show)
   - Must be SPECIFIC (not vague like "basic functionality")
   - Examples: "Working login button", "Score display system", "Character animation"

6. SESSIONS PER WEEK: Realistic coding session count:
   - 1-week projects: 3-5 sessions
   - 2-week projects: 2-4 sessions per week
   - 3-4 week projects: 3-4 sessions per week

   - Use action verbs: "Build", "Create", "Implement", "Design"
   - Make them feel accomplished and capable

VALIDATION CHECKLIST - BEFORE RESPONDING, CHECK:
□ Number of weeks matches project duration exactly
□ Each week builds logically on previous weeks
□ Concepts are appropriate for stated difficulty level
□ Deliverables are concrete and demonstrable
□ Sessions count is realistic for children
□ Milestones are in chronological order by target_week
□ Milestone count is between 2-5
□ All milestone titles are exciting and child-friendly
□ Success criteria are specific and actionable
