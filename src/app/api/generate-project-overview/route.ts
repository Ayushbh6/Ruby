ADVANCED CONCEPTS (choose 6-8):
- "API integration" (connecting to external services)

- "State management" (tracking application changes)

FORMATTING RULES:
- Each concept should be 2-4 words maximum
- Use quotes around each concept: "concept name"
- Separate with commas: "concept 1", "concept 2", "concept 3"
- NO technical jargon - explain in parentheses if needed
- Order from simple to complex within the list

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:
